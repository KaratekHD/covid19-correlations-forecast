## Summary

- Normal life may return when enough of the population has immunity to Covid-19, limiting further spread. This is known as "herd immunity". ([COVID-19 Vaccines and Herd Immunity; Harvard Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics](https://ccdd.hsph.harvard.edu/2020/12/17/covid-19-vaccines-and-herd-immunity/))

- Herd immunity may be achieved either through infection and recovery or by vaccination. [[1](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2772168)]

- Herd immunity also protects those who are unable to be vaccinated, such as newborns and immunocompromised people, because the disease spread within the population is very limited. [[1](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2772168)]

- Though one dose may offer partial immunity, only the second vaccine dose is counted in the above visualizations.

## How much of the population needs immunity?

- The herd immunity threshold is debated among scientists. A commonly accepted herd immunity threshold for SARS-CoV-2 is 60-80%. This does not factor in pre-existing immunity. [[2](https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3563)] [[4](https://ccdd.hsph.harvard.edu/2020/12/17/covid-19-vaccines-and-herd-immunity/)]

- At least six studies have reported T cell reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 in 20% to 50% of people with no known exposure to the virus. Several studies were published in the prestigious *Cell* and *Nature* journals. [[2](https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3563)] [[3](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)30610-3)]

- When a population has people with pre-existing immunity, as the T cell studies may be indicating is the case, the herd immunity threshold based on an R0 of 2.5 can be reduced from 60% of a population getting infected right down to 10%. (Sunetra Gupta at the University of Oxford) [[2](https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3563)]

- To factor in a population fraction that may have pre-existing immunity use the "Cross Immunity" slider. This will update all charts and values.

- Researchers believe pre-existing immunity may come from the immune system's knowledge of other cornoviruses, such as the ones that contribute to the common cold.

> Importantly, we detected SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4+ T cells in ∼40%–60% of unexposed individuals, suggesting cross-reactive T cell recognition between circulating “common cold” coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2.  [[3](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)30610-3)]
