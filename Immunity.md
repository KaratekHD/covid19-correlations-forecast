## Summary

- Normal life may return when enough of the population has immunity to Covid-19, limiting further spread. This is known as "herd immunity". ([COVID-19 Vaccines and Herd Immunity; Harvard Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics](https://ccdd.hsph.harvard.edu/2020/12/17/covid-19-vaccines-and-herd-immunity/))

- Herd immunity may be achieved either through infection and recovery or by vaccination. [[1](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2772168)]

- Herd immunity also protects those who are unable to be vaccinated, such as newborns and immunocompromised people, because the disease spread within the population is very limited. [[1](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2772168)]

- Though one dose may offer some immunity, only the second vaccine dose is counted in the above visualizations.

## How much of the population needs immunity?

- The herd immunity threshold is debated among scientists. A commonly accepted herd immunity threshold for SARS-CoV-2 is 60-80%, though other research has suggested 10-20%.
