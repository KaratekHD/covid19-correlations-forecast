## Summary

- Herd immunity occurs when a significant portion of a population becomes immune to an infectious disease, limiting further disease spread. [[1](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2772168)]

- Herd immunity may be achieved either through infection and recovery or by vaccination. [[1](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2772168)]

- At least six studies have reported T cell reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 in 20% to 50% of people with no known exposure to the virus. Several studies were published in the prestigious *Cell* and *Nature* journals. [[2](https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3563)] [[3](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)30610-3)]

- When a population has people with pre-existing immunity, as the T cell studies may be indicating is the case, the herd immunity threshold based on an R0 of 2.5 can be reduced from 60% of a population getting infected right down to 10%. [[2](https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3563)]

- To factor in a population fraction that may have pre-existing immunity use the "Cross Immunity" slider. This will update all charts and values.

## More Information

> Herd immunity also protects those who are unable to be vaccinated, such as newborns and immunocompromised people, because the disease spread within the population is very limited. [[1](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2772168)] 

The herd immunity threshold is debated among scientists [[2](https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3563)].

According to the [British Medical Journal](https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3563):  

> **At least six studies have reported T cell reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 in 20% to 50% of people with no known exposure to the virus...they are hard to dismiss, with several being published in *Cell* and *Nature*.**  

> Another group led by Sunetra Gupta at the University of Oxford has arrived at similar conclusions of lower herd immunity thresholds by considering the issue of pre-existing immunity in the population. **When a population has people with pre-existing immunity, as the T cell studies may be indicating is the case, the herd immunity threshold based on an R0 of 2.5 can be reduced from 60% of a population getting infected right down to 10%**, depending on the quantity and distribution of pre-existing immunity among people, Gupta’s group calculated.  

Researchers believe the pre-existing immunity may come from the immune system's experience with other cornoviruses, such as the ones that cause the common cold.  

> Importantly, we detected SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4+ T cells in ∼40%–60% of unexposed individuals, **suggesting cross-reactive T cell recognition between circulating “common cold” coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2**.  [[3](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)30610-3)]
