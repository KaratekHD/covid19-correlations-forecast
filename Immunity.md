## When can we go back to normal?

When the herd immunity threshold is reached.  

> Herd immunity occurs when a significant portion of a population becomes immune to an infectious disease, limiting further disease spread.  

> **Herd immunity may be achieved either through infection and recovery or by vaccination.** Herd immunity also protects those who are unable to be vaccinated, such as newborns and immunocompromised people, because the disease spread within the population is very limited.

## What is the threshold? 

This is debated among scientists.

One factor that may drastically alter the herd immunity threshold (HIT) is pre-existing immunity from other coronaviruses like the common cold.  

According to the [British Medical Journal](https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3563):  

> **At least six studies have reported T cell reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 in 20% to 50% of people with no known exposure to the virus...they are hard to dismiss, with several being published in *Cell* and *Nature*.**  

> Another group led by Sunetra Gupta at the University of Oxford has arrived at similar conclusions of lower herd immunity thresholds by considering the issue of pre-existing immunity in the population. When a population has people with pre-existing immunity, as the T cell studies may be indicating is the case,**the herd immunity threshold based on an R0 of 2.5 can be reduced from 60% of a population getting infected right down to 10%, depending on the quantity and distribution of pre-existing immunity among people**, Gupta’s group calculated.  

Researchers believe the pre-existing immunity may come from the immune system's experience with other cornoviruses, such as the ones that cause the common cold.  

> Importantly, we detected SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4+ T cells in ∼40%–60% of unexposed individuals, **suggesting cross-reactive T cell recognition between circulating “common cold” coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2**.
